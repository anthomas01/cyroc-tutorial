Hi my name is Kyle Warrington

I am going into my third year at ISU as a Mechanical Engineer. 

My strongest language is probably Matlab as of right now, but it has been awhile since I've 
done much with it. I have used a little Python and C++ in highschool. 

I'm interested in learning CFD because it is one of those larger areas in engineering that I don't know anything
about and I really enjoy learning new ways to figure out a problem.
